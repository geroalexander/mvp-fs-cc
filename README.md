## Blog App
This is a simple full-stack blog app written in TypeScript with Node.js on the backend and React.js on the frontend. The app allows users to view all posts, create new ones, and see a single post. Please note that due to time constraints, we did not focus much on styling, and there is no delete functionality of one post as per instructions.

### How to Start
To get started, you must first navigate to the client directory and run npm start. Then, navigate to the server directory and run npm run start to start nodemon.

```bash
cd client
npm start
cd ../server
npm run start
```

### Using the Application
The user can create a new post, view one post, and view all posts. They can also navigate around the application.

### Tech Stack
The backend is built using Express.js, while the frontend is built using React.js and TailwindCss.

Thank you for using our application. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to reach out.
